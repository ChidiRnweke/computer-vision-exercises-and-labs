# Exercises and labs for the computer vision course of KU Leuven

The code wil not run as the data is on Kaggle and otherwise. The notebooks as from assignment two and three do have detailed explanations and are thus useful. Assignment 3 in particular has a seperate notebook called 'AdversiaralAttack.ipynb' which contains a more detailed explanation of the approach used, which is in some ways novel.

## assignment 0: Gaussian kernel from scratch
## assignment 1: Basic operations on a video
## assignment 2: Traditional image processing and computer vison (SIFT, HOG, PCA) *and* a deep learning based approach
## assignment 3: Deep learning for computer vision: Instance segmenation, classification and adversial attacks
